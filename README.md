    Navigate to the script folder:

cd Power-Shell-Toolkits

    Open and run any script in PowerShell as Administrator. Example:

.\TxtToEventLog.ps1

    Check Windows Event Viewer or follow the script‚Äôs instructions for output.

 Customization

    Modify script variables to match your environment (e.g., file paths, log names, event sources).

    Adjust EntryType for Information, Warning, or Error logs.

    Change EventId to categorize different events.

 Notes

    Administrator privileges are required for scripts that create Event Sources.

    For large files, consider batching to prevent overloading the Event Log.
